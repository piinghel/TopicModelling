The link might not always work due to memory issues.

To run the app locally:
 
 1) Download the repository (upper right corner **Code** and **Download ZIP**)
 2) Open your terminal (for example anaconda) and make sure you are in the folder where the `requirment.txt` file and `app.py` are located
 3) run `pip install -r requirments.txt`
 4) run `streamlit run app.py`

 **Possible issues:** in case you have trouble with installing the **hnswlib** library, 
 try to install it via `conda install -c conda-forge hnswlib`
