After breaking ground on 685 Gateway Boulevard in our South San Francisco submarket, we made significant progress in 2019 toward making this cutting-edge development project the first Zero Energy Certified building in Alexandrias asset base. Upon certification from the ILFI, it will be one of only approximately 60 Zero Energy certified projects in the world. (See the case study on pages 1415.) Targeting high levels of green building certification enables us to deliver energy-and resource-efficient buildings that also meet or exceed tenant, city, and state requirements for energy, water, material sourcing, biodiversity, and alternative transportation.

For new construction projects, Alexandria seeks to procure products with Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs), which provide information on product composition and environmental impact. Alexandria is proud sponsor and early adopter of the Carbon Leadership Forums Embodied Carbon in Construction Calculator (EC3) tool. This coalition of more than 30 forward-looking and innovative building industry leaders has taken on long-elusive goal: measuring, reducing, and ultimately eliminating the substantial carbon footprint of construction materials.

Going forward, we will continue to use the EC3 tool for additional new Class development and redevelopment properties.

These capabilities have enabled us to successfully reimagine and create dynamic campuses such as the Alexandria Center for Life Science in New York City; the Alexandria Center at Kendall Square in Cambridge, which encompasses buildings along the Binney Street Corridor; and numerous properties in our Mission Bay/SoMa submarket of San Francisco.	144	28

Big Yellow is well aware of its corporate social responsibility and recognises the positive contribution it can make to address environmental concerns and sustainability issues. Big Yellow Self Storage East Finchley is constructed from materials with high recycled content including: steel; aluminium window frames; particle board flooring and walls; breeze blocks and solid insulation.	38	2
Big Yellow Group	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2007.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/b/LSE_BYG_2007.pdf	BigYellowGroup-2007.pdf	more detailed explanation of our approach to managing and minimising the impact of our development on the environment is set out below. Big Yellow develops stores in environments in which people live and work. We build storage centres for our customers who live or work within three to five mile radius providing storage solution for businesses and households. East Finchley p02 The Big Yellow store model is now well established. The typical store contains 60,000 sq ft of net lettable space, and takes some 2.5 years to achieve 85% occupancy. The average room size is some 60 sq ft and the average rental achieved last year across the 43 stores was 23.79 per sq ft per annum. The store is initially run by three staff adding part timer	38	3
Big Yellow Group	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2007.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/b/LSE_BYG_2007.pdf	BigYellowGroup-2007.pdf	once the store occupancy justifies the need for the extra administrative and sales workload. During the year we opened six stores, three in London (at East Finchley, Kingston & Edmon-ton), one at Tunbridge Wells, second store at Bristol Ashton Gate, and one at Gloucester. These store openings bring the number now trading to 43. The available net lettable space increased by 360,000 sq ft over the year to 2.6 million sq ft with the opening of these six stores. The maturity profile across the 43 stores open at the end of the year shows portfolio of 71% (1.84 million sq ft occupied), with the 30 stores more than two years old at an aver age occupancy of 85%. Big Yellow Self Storage, Tunbridge Wells like other store in the portfolio has materials with high	38	4

The total construction spend in the year was 30 million and is expected to be approximately 45 million in 2007/8. We currently have seven new stores all of which are under construction. We believe that as customer facing real estate business it is sustainable to maintain the quality of our estate and customer services. We therefore continue to invest in rolling programme of store makeovers, preventative maintenance,	38	5

Tunbridge Wells p03 Maintaining and improving the quality of the built environment in which we live is an important concern for the Group, its staff, customers, suppliers and the communities in which we operate. Big Yellow endeavours to balance the triple bottom line of financial, social and environmental.	38	6
Big Yellow Group	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2007.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/b/LSE_BYG_2007.pdf	BigYellowGroup-2007.pdf	Responsibility The Directors of Big Yellow are committed to ensuring its development and operational activities do not place an unnecessary burden on future generations. Big Yellow is well aware of its corporate social responsibility and the company recognises the positive contribution it can make to address environmental concerns and sustainability issues. James Gibson, CEO, has responsibility to the Board on all matters of environmental policy.	38	7
Big Yellow Group	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2007.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/b/LSE_BYG_2007.pdf	BigYellowGroup-2007.pdf	Commitment To demonstrate our commitment to the environment we are recruiting full time environ-mental manager to increase the pace of change within the company. In recognition of the UK regulatory objectives and growing environmental awareness of consumers, Big Yellow has initiated simple, straightforward alterations to its behaviour to reduce its carbon foot-print. Furthermore the Group are investing over 1.0 million in renewable energy technolo-gies in new developments at Barking, Balham, Fulham and Kennington. This investment forms key part of detailed study into the building design to quantify the energy, material and waste usage and benefits of the new technologies in use and to consider where improvements could be introduced within the existing and new stores portfolio.	38	8
Big Yellow Group	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2007.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/b/LSE_BYG_2007.pdf	BigYellowGroup-2007.pdf	Big Yellow stores are in the main part constructed of steel (structural, mezzanine, cladding, partitioning, roof, roller shutter doors, fences and gates) material with high recycled content which is usually reused or recycled in the future. The mezzanine floors offers flexibility such that the building can be re-used for different purposes in the future.	38	9
Big Yellow Group	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2007.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/b/LSE_BYG_2007.pdf	BigYellowGroup-2007.pdf	p04 There are many ways in which Big Yellow currently achieves its environmental objectives, the main examples of which are set out below. Climate Change, Flood Risk and Water Conservation We conserve water resources by minimising the number of sanitary fittings and include flow control systems within the staff kitchen and store facilities. Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS) and rainwater harvesting are being installed at stores under construction to meet Environment Agency requirements for surface water attenuation and irrigation.	38	10
Big Yellow Group	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2007.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/b/LSE_BYG_2007.pdf	BigYellowGroup-2007.pdf	Sustainable Materials We are designing new stores with products that are more sustainable. We select building materials responsibly, with low embodied energy, which are easily reusable and which are procured from sustainable sources. The buildings are in the main part constructed of steel, material with high recycled content which could also be reused or recycled in the future. The mezzanine floors offers flexibility such that the building can be re-used for different purposes in the future.	38	11
Big Yellow Group	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2007.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/b/LSE_BYG_2007.pdf	BigYellowGroup-2007.pdf	Passive Buildings Big Yellow storage has low carbon foot-print and we always meet or exceed building regu-lations which require high insulation standards to the building envelope. We only heat or cool our reception areas which on standard stores occupy only 3% of the gross floor area. Big Yellow Self Storage Edmonton, like other more recent stores in the portfolio, has energy efficient cladding with solid insulation that reduces daily and seasonal temperature variations within the storage area. No heating and cooling is required in about 97% of the store area.	38	12

On our recent stores we have moved from hydraulic lifts to more energy efficient traction lifts where there are more than four floors. Swipe card entry activates lighting only in the area where customer storage is located and more energy efficient lifts are installed where there are four floors or more.	38	13
Big Yellow Group	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2007.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/b/LSE_BYG_2007.pdf	BigYellowGroup-2007.pdf	Big Yellow also obtains its electricity supplies from service provider with green energy policy which generates some electricity from renewable sources and researches additional renewable energy capacity. Renewable Energy We are planning and investing in renewable energy sources where practicable and financially viable at our stores in Barking, Balham, Fulham and Kennington. The social, economic and environmental benefits will be monitored and form the basis of future eco-store strategy.	38	14

We invest significantly in training and have reward structure and performance monitoring systems which focus specifically on achieving sales and customer service objectives. p13 During the review of Big Yellows store development program and operational activities the following environmental and social aspects were identified as having the most significant direct impacts, either positive or negative, on local communities and the environment. The most significant impact was the carbon foot print of the operational stores due to the long term use of energy, compared to the shorter and smaller demands from store development and work related travel. Big Yellow has calculated its basic equivalent carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions using DEFRA	67	37

These emissions are caused directly and indirectly by its activities, but excluding employee travel and supply chain operations. Store Energy Consumption Big Yellow stores have two types of carbon emission. Typical energy consumption is predominantly grid electricity for lighting (73%) and lifts (27%), which cause indirect off site power station carbon emissions. Eight stores with flexi-offices have additional gas heated areas which cause direct onsite gas combustion carbon emissions. Work related travel emissions from private and public transport will be estimated in the year ending 31 March 2009 from an employee survey. Customer travel emissions are more difficult to measure accurately but can be based on store distance, move-in or out variability and visit frequency.	67	38
Big Yellow Group	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2008.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/b/LSE_BYG_2008.pdf	BigYellowGroup-2008.pdf	Stores Carbon Emissions The store energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions per square metre of final storage space have decreased on average by about 3.5% per year. The table below summarises the position over the last four years: This reduction has been due to the Groups new store development program moving away from refurbishing older buildings towards purpose built stores, with higher standards of insulation, air tightness and energy efficiency. Future years should see continued improvement in this trend through the use of more energy efficient lighting and improved lift specification.	67	39

The annual energy usage in the table above increased even though we opened the same number of stores in the year. This was because the projects were larger and more complex, requiring more energy use than in the previous year.

Employee responses to the survey were an excellent 85% indicating the level of interest and concern for travel and the estimated total carbon footprint of employee travel has been increasing annually based on the new store development programme and increasing employment. The estimated employee travel carbon footprint from 2007 to 2009 is shown below.	54	17
Big Yellow Group	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2009.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/b/LSE_BYG_2009.pdf	BigYellowGroup-2009.pdf	Big Yellow Once the findings from the employee feedback have been reviewed in more detail by the Board, the CSR Committee will be able to develop new strategies and reduce the environmental impact of our work travel foot-print. Stakeholder Health and Safety The Group has Store, Head Office and Construction Health and Safety Policies that are reviewed on quarterly basis. Accident books are used to record incidents and these are recorded centrally. The number of accidents, injuries and near misses in stores are documented in the table below.	54	18
Big Yellow Group	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2009.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/b/LSE_BYG_2009.pdf	BigYellowGroup-2009.pdf	Customer minor injuries have been predominantly through handling of goods when putting them in or taking them out of self storage. Staff minor injuries have been related to store management duties. There were only few incidents involving contractors and other visitors to the store. For the year ended 31 March 2009 minor incidents increased, but no notices or prosecutions were served. Health and safety risks are assessed by independent consultants for Store and Head Office. Approximately six stores per year are audited by an external consultant and feedback has helped to reduce incidents against rising number of store openings. Head office and store staff are trained in first aid and all staff are retrained every three years.	54	19

The most significant impact was the carbon foot print of the operational stores due to the long term use of energy, compared to the shorter demands from store development and work related travel. Big Yellow has calculated its equivalent carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions using DEFRA conversion data (June 2008). These emissions are caused directly and indirectly by its store operations, store construction and employee travel.	54	29
Big Yellow Group	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2009.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/b/LSE_BYG_2009.pdf	BigYellowGroup-2009.pdf	Operational Store Energy Consumption and Carbon Foot Print Big Yellow stores have two types of carbon emission. Typical energy consumption is predominantly grid electricity for lighting, lifts, heating, cooling and ventilation, which cause indirect off site power station carbon emissions. Stores with flexi-offices have additional gas heated areas which cause direct onsite gas combustion carbon emissions. Work related travel emissions from private and public transport has been estimated by an employee travel survey conducted in the year ended 31 March 2009.	54	30
Big Yellow Group	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2009.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/b/LSE_BYG_2009.pdf	BigYellowGroup-2009.pdf	The store electricity consumption and carbon dioxide emissions per square metre of final occupied storage space have decreased by approximately 3.5% in the year ended March 2009. The table below summarises the usage and emissions over the last five years: Taking into account reduction in store occupied area, Big Yellow reduced its electricity consumption by over 1 million kWh and its carbon dioxide emissions by 7.4% relating to electricity use reduction. The carbon reduction over the year ended March 2009 was 1.2 kg CO2 / m2 exceeding our 2008 target of 0.5 kg CO2 / m2. This reduction was due to the Groups new store development program of higher standards of insulation, air tightness, energy efficiency and renewable energy generation. It was also due to the	54	31

Energy Supplier Carbon Off-setting During the year, Big Yellow reviewed its carbon off-setting policy in the context of the Climate Change Act and the Carbon Reduction Commitment (CRC). We have decided to change our strategy and not to continue purchasing electricity through our suppliers Green Tariff beyond October 2009. Big Yellow has decided to transfer resources to invest in improving store energy efficiency instead.	54	32

This year, the six stores being built that were under fit-out construction were measured using improved data collection for diesel consumption and grid electricity use. Total diesel fuel and grid electricity use measurement improved and we now have good procedures in place to measure and report on future energy usage on construction fit out. Diesel use on average fell in 2009 due to the Liverpool and Twickenham sites using grid electricity. Grid electricity usage was higher, but produces lower carbon dioxide emissions. The use of on-site diesel creates approximately 15 times more carbon emissions than grid electricity. In total carbon emission reduction of about 34% was achieved and carbon reduction per square metre of	54	36

Overall construction fit out carbon emissions account for approximately 15% of the Groups total carbon footprint. Summary of Big Yellows Carbon Footprint Calculating our carbon footprint has helped us prepare for the Climate Change Act and in particular the Carbon Reduction Commitment (CRC) we will be compiling from 2010. During 2009 we have obtained more accurate data, reduced some types of emissions and improved energy efficiency.	54	37

To date, Big Yellows new stores have energy ratings based on the performance potential of the building fabric and its heating, ventilation, lighting and renewable energy installations. The energy ratings given on the certificates reflect the intrinsic energy performance standard of the building relative to benchmark which can then be used to make comparisons with similar buildings. To date the most recent of Big Yellows new stores (Twickenham, Sheffield, Edinburgh and Birmingham) have been certified one level above expected energy efficiency benchmarks for new buildings. In the case of the Twickenham store, rating was achieved that was two ratings above the benchmark for new buildings and it has	54	41

Renewable Energy Generation (FY 2009) In the year ended 31 March 2009, four stores (Barking, Balham, Fulham and Merton) have been generating energy for most of the year and energy generation data has totalled 57,000 kWh, resulting in carbon emission saving of 24.5 tonnes of CO2 equivalent (CO2te). The solar photo voltaic installations are approaching the 10% CO2 reduction targets set by the Local Planning Authorities. To date solar photovoltaic energy has proved to be the most reliable method of meeting Local Planning Authority energy and carbon dioxide reduction targets. Ground source heat pumps have provided adequate heating to the reception areas in the winter season; while small scale wind turbines have not proven to be successful in urban environments, where the wind flow is turbulent and therefore less effective.	54	42

These programmes add value to the store portfolio and financial savings in operations, for every kWh of renewable energy generated and grid electricity displaced, while reducing carbon emissions and operational costs. CSR Policy Big Yellows CSR Policy commits the Group to striking the balance between its social, economic and environmental responsibilities as an operator and developer of self storage buildings. In order to continue to develop sustainable business the Board has once more committed significant resources to the CSR aspects of its operations. Our CSR policy also sets overarching environmental and social objectives for the Group which are measured by key performance indicators (KPIs), the most significant of which have been reported below.	84	4
Big Yellow Group	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2010.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/b/LSE_BYG_2010.pdf	BigYellowGroup-2010.pdf	CSR Management Overall responsibility for the CSR Policy is provided by the Operations Director, Adrian Lee, through regular CSR committee meetings chaired by the CSR Manager. The Groups Board Reports communicate progress on CSR objectives to all of the Directors. Through this structure, the CSR Manager continues to integrate social and environmental aspects of the Groups new developments and store operations into its existing management systems, balanced with its commercial objectives.	84	5

This year, we have restated our carbon emission data for the last three financial years, in line with the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECCs) new guide lines. We have also restated our health and safety data over the same period of time in order to introduce the more comparable Annual Injury Incidence Rate (AIIR) indicator. Store and construction waste management performance have been measured in order to monitor these relatively lower scale, environmental impacts. The KPIs benchmark our current CSR performance and its continued improvement over the past three years. Based on the benchmark data for the year ended 31 March 2010 and external performance standards, the	84	6
Big Yellow Group	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2010.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/b/LSE_BYG_2010.pdf	BigYellowGroup-2010.pdf	Group will set new targets, where appropriate, for the year ended 31 March 2011. Scope of CSR Report This report focuses on the establishment of our CSR policies in the new stores that were under construction and opened in the financial year ended 31 March 2010. These include our stores at: Twickenham; Edinburgh; Nottingham; Poole; Sheffield (Bramall Lane); Reading and High Wycombe. We also report on the continuing CSR performance of the existing self storage portfolio and their ongoing operations.

HIGHLIGHTS Below is summary of the CSR highlights for this financial year: 1. The Environmental Real Estate Index In February 2010, research commissioned by the Universities Superannuation Scheme, APG Asset Management and PGGM Investments reported that out of 688 property companies surveyed Big Yellow was the leader in the pan European Environmental Real Estate Index and was ranked second globally. The index compares property companies environmental credentials based on evidence of environmental management practices and their implementation.	84	8
Big Yellow Group	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2010.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/b/LSE_BYG_2010.pdf	BigYellowGroup-2010.pdf	. The Carbon Trust Standard (CTS) In January 2010, Big Yellow received certification for achieving the CTS. The certificate was awarded because of our reduction in carbon emissions across the whole store portfolio and operations with an absolute reduction of 4.8% and relative reduction to turnover of 7.8%. It shows that Big Yellow is at the forefront of reducing the carbon emissions that it is directly responsible for, rather than just paying others to off-set their emissions.	84	9
Big Yellow Group	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2010.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/b/LSE_BYG_2010.pdf	BigYellowGroup-2010.pdf	. Store Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) Our new store in Twickenham achieved Big Yellows first net zero carbon EPC. Net zero carbon means that over period of one year, the predicted national grid electricity demand and associated power station carbon emissions would be equal to or less than the energy saved by increased building insulation, energy efficient design and specifications, and the supply of on-site renewable energy. Only about 3% of the whole store area required heating and cooling and the predicted EPC recorded-5 kg CO2 emissions per square metre.	84	10
Big Yellow Group	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2010.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/b/LSE_BYG_2010.pdf	BigYellowGroup-2010.pdf	. Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Methodology (BREEAM) In December 2009, Big Yellows new store in Reading was the second store in the portfolio to achieve an Excellent BREEAM rating, after Sheen last year. It is one of the highest benchmarks of environmental excellence required by planning authorities. Ratings were highest for design and construction energy efficiency, renewable energy, sustainable materials use, waste recycling, water efficiency and landscape biodiversity.	84	11

These companies will form league table that will trade in carbon deficits and surpluses. In order to prepare for this legislation Big Yellow has been measuring and reporting its total energy use and carbon emissions in its Annual Report since CRC legislation is an economic instrument that requires companies to conduct long term planning and investment to deliver energy efficiencies. Big Yellow has successfully demonstrated reduction in the absolute amount of carbon it has been emitting year on year; even whilst undertaking substantial expansion in its store opening programme in the last 12 months. This achievement was certified by obtaining the Carbon Trust Standard in 2010.	84	46

CSR KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS The most significant environmental impact of Big Yellows activities is its carbon emissions from operational stores. This is due to the longer term use of energy in these stores, compared to the shorter demands from store construction and work related travel. Big Yellow has re-calculated its carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions for the past three years using the new DEFRA / DECC conversion factors published on 30 September, 2009.	84	56

This type of emission is classified as Scope 2 from power station combustion. The table below summarises the Companys usage and emissions over the last three years: Store Electricity Use, CO2 Emissions and Carbon Intensity Year 2008 2009 2010 2011 Target Electricity Use (kWh) 13,899,604 12,866,186 12,730,855 (1.1%) Absolute carbon emissions (Kg CO2) 7,547,902 6,986,725 6,913,236 (1.1%) (1%) Carbon Intensity (Kg CO2 / m2 total space) 27.6 23.9 23.1 (3.4%) (3%) Carbon Intensity (Kg CO2 / m2 occupied space) 44.7 43.4 38.9 (10.4%) (3%) Big Yellow achieved second absolute reduction in store energy use and carbon emissions of 1% (2009: 7.4%).

Carbon dioxide emissions per square metre of total storage space, also known as Carbon Intensity, takes into account the growth of the store portfolio. This measure decreased by 3.4%, exceeding our 3% Carbon Intensity reduction target for 2010. Carbon reduction relative to occupied space, taking into account business activity; showed significant 10.4% saving in energy use and carbon emissions compared to previous years. Our target will be to continue to reduce carbon intensity by 3% for 2011. This will become more challenging target to achieve, as the benefit of our investments in store energy efficiency become less able to deliver significant savings.	84	58

Longer term energy efficiency programmes will also be reviewed where appropriate technologies can be identified. 12 Corporate Social Responsibility Report (continued) 5.5 RENEWABLE ENERGY In the year ended 31 March 2010 further four stores generating renewable energy were added to the portfolio. To date Big Yellow has renewable energy assets that include ten solar photo-voltaic installations, five ground source heat pumps and two wind turbines. The generation from ground source heat pumps has been estimated using manufacturers specifications. Next year guidance from the Feed in Tariff for ground source heat pumps will be used for more accurate readings.	84	63

Renewable energy generated from these stores will be measured at the end of next year to compare specification against actual performance and to gain cash back from the Feed in Tariff for energy generated and used on site. 6. STORE PLANNING, DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION The following section summarises Big Yellows initiatives to reduce its carbon footprint and increase its environmental performance through store design, specification and the installation of renewable energy technologies.	84	65
Big Yellow Group	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2010.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/b/LSE_BYG_2010.pdf	BigYellowGroup-2010.pdf	Planning authorities require environmental assessments of new building designs and construction to be undertaken. In December 2009 our new Reading Store achieved an Excellent rating from the Building Research Establishments Environmental Assessment Methodology (BREEAM). The environmental performance of the Reading store performed well in the design and construction stages for energy efficiency, renewable energy, materials selection, waste management, water conservation and landscape biodiversity amongst other criteria. The excellent BREEAM rating at Reading follows on from the same rating we achieved in 2009 at Sheen. These types of environmental assessments are required for several of our future stores and we aim for more Excellent and Very Good ratings in the future. The tables below summarises all the environmental performance improvement features from our most recent stores developments (our Eco-stores).	84	66

This statement is intended to provide Big Yellows stakeholders with assurance that the information contained within this report is accurate and reliable. The objectives of the verification assignment are to:	84	78
Big Yellow Group	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2010.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/b/LSE_BYG_2010.pdf	BigYellowGroup-2010.pdf	> Provide limited assurance of selected report content, including all Key Performance Indicator (KPI) data for the year ended 31 March 2010 and limited number of factual statements relating to the Companys CSR activities in the year ended 31 March 2010. > Test the underlying systems and processes that are in place for the gathering and analysis of selected information contained within this report. This statement does not seek to provide commentary on Big Yellows CSR policies, targets, performance or strategy, nor performance prior to the financial year ended 31 March 2010.	84	79
Big Yellow Group	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2010.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/b/LSE_BYG_2010.pdf	BigYellowGroup-2010.pdf	The limited scope of the verification statement means that it is not intended to be used as the basis for any decisions, including financial or investment decisions. Methodology As part of this verification assignment, Jones Lang LaSalle undertook the following: > review of management reports and data spreadsheets produced in the period 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2010 by Big Yellow. The purpose of this review was to verify the factual statements and KPI data included within the scope of this assignment. As such, we have only verified data collection systems and processes. We have not verified data or factual statements at source.	84	80
Big Yellow Group	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2010.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/b/LSE_BYG_2010.pdf	BigYellowGroup-2010.pdf	> Interviewed the CSR Manager at Big Yellow to corroborate findings from management reports and data spreadsheets to build picture of the underlying data collection systems and processes. Findings and recommendations Based on the findings of this verification assignment, it is Jones Lang LaSalles opinion that: > The KPI data and factual statements reviewed accurately reflect the data recorded by Big Yellow as part of standard management reporting and data collation processes for the CSR report.	84	81
Big Yellow Group	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2010.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/b/LSE_BYG_2010.pdf	BigYellowGroup-2010.pdf	> The underlying management systems for recording KPI data across stores, fit out and construction activities appears to be sufficiently robust for reporting purposes. In certain circumstances these systems could be improved to make the verification process more efficient and to make performance measurement more effective, particularly with regards to waste data. Jones Lang LaSalle therefore recommends that Big Yellow develops more formal data capture and recording systems for waste KPIs in particular.	84	82

INTRODUCTION Big Yellows CSR Policy aims to strike the balance between its social, economic and environmental responsibilities as an owner, operator and developer of self storage buildings. Overall responsibility for the CSR Policy is provided by the Operations Director, through regular CSR committee meetings chaired by the CSR Manager. The Groups Board Reports communicate progress on our CSR objectives to the Companys Directors. In order to maintain sustainable business for its customers, staff and investors, the Board has committed significant resources to the social and environmental aspects of its operations. These are measured by key performance indicators (KPIs), the most significant of which are reported below.	50	5

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Highlights Our CSR programme for 2011 committed us to focus on our most significant environmental challenge of energy efficiency and carbon reduction. In order to achieve these objectives we: 1. increased the roll-out of our store lighting energy efficiency re-lamping programmes, 41% of the estate is now converted; 2.	50	6
Big Yellow Group	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2011.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/b/LSE_BYG_2011.pdf	BigYellowGroup-2011.pdf	reduced store carbon intensity emissions by 2.1%; 3. reduced Construction Fit Out carbon emissions by 63.5%; 4. increased solar panel electricity generation by 20.6%; 5. increased renewable energy generation by 11.5%; and 6. generated 255 MWh of solar electricity and 398 MWh of cumulative renewable energy since 2008. Our most significant social and environmental performance indicators are summarised as follows: This year store carbon emissions (including our head office at Bagshot and one warehouse building) represents 97.48% of our emissions, with flexi office gas accounting for 1.56% of emissions and construction fit out only 0.96% of emissions.	50	7

Also, through the Sunday Times Best Green Companies survey, we want future customers to know about the actions we are taking to reduce the impact of our business on the environment. 3.2 Our Staff CSR training was provided to our store staff in response to feedback from our annual staff survey. Presentations were held at our Tunbridge Wells, Edmonton, Birmingham and Twickenham stores. Topics covered included our CSR policy, carbon reduction, energy efficiency, and renewable energy initiatives. New staff environmental inductions were provided at our High Wycombe, Camberley and Eltham stores and Green Travel Plans were established at Camberley and Eltham. Following staff travel carbon footprint survey in October 2008, tax efficient bicycle purchase scheme was implemented. This scheme has resulted in staff purchasing 30 bicycles in the first 15 months of the scheme to 31 March 2011. Cycle	50	11

We also participated in the Sunday Times Best Green Companies 2011 employee survey. The aim of participating in the survey is to gather staff opinions on our green business policies and to help us recognise what we are doing well and where we need to improve. 3.3 Governmental Organisations We participated in the Green Deal ministerial event on improving energy efficiency in non-domestic buildings, in October 2010. Discussions were held on key business roles and the funding mechanism for businesses that would involve energy efficiency technology providers, certifiers and energy supply companies. We also participated in consultation and workshop in February 2011, for the review of the Governments Carbon Reduction Commitment (Climate Change Act 2010) in order to prepare for changes in reporting on our Carbon Footprint, our Annual Report and	50	12

We achieved rating in the Financials sector along with Hammerson, Great Portland Estates, Segro, British Land Company, Derwent and Shaftesbury. The top rated Financials were the Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC Holdings and Barclays. CDP7 provides coordinating secretariat for institutional investors with combined US $57 trillion of assets under management. Big Yellow also presented at the Maastricht Universitys international Green Building Finance and Investment conference, organised by the managers of the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB). It was an exchange of insights and knowledge from investors,	50	13

We have calculated carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions using the latest DECC conversion factors. 4.1 Store Energy Use Carbon Dioxide Emissions Electricity is used for lighting, lifts, heating, cooling and ventilation. This type of emission is classified as Scope 2 or offsite power station fossil fuel emissions. We are reporting and re-stating carbon intensity data by gross internal area (GIA), rather than final storage area, because it is more representative of lighting use in reception, office, store corridors and stairwells.

Our target will be to continue to reduce carbon intensity as we achieve occupancy growth by our continued investments in store energy efficiency. 4.2 Store Lighting Energy Efficiency Programmes Our new stores at High Wycombe and Camberley were opened with energy saving motion sensor lighting and energy efficient T5 lamps, installed by Big Yellow Construction. LED lighting is also being trailed in the Camberley store reception area. New energy efficient stores, from our Kennington store opening onwards, now number 14 Eco-stores. further 26 stores from the older portfolio have been re-lamped by our Facilities Management team, with energy efficient T5 lamps or energy efficient power adaptors fitted to existing T8 lamps to achieve 30% energy saving.	50	18
Big Yellow Group	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2011.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/b/LSE_BYG_2011.pdf	BigYellowGroup-2011.pdf	Seven stores were converted to energy efficiency upgrades (Battersea, Dagenham, Hounslow, Croydon, Guildford, Ilford and Hanger Lane) in the financial year ending 31 March 2011. Our Facilities Management energy efficiency lighting programme is now 41% complete. Zoning of sensor lighting was carried out at Bow in September 2010, which has increased the control of lighting use further. Sensors only activate energy efficient lighting in zones where customer activity is detected. Facilities Management intend to roll-out this control to eight further stores and also carry out 10 energy saving re-lamps in the financial year ending 31 March 2012 to achieve 57% completion.	50	19

Big Yellow Group	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2011.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/b/LSE_BYG_2011.pdf	BigYellowGroup-2011.pdf	This is the first year since the financial year ending 31 March 2008 in which Big Yellow has not achieved an absolute carbon reduction. Only in fit out construction was there significant carbon reduction mainly due to lower development programme. The number of new stores opened (two) and under construction (six) remained relatively low compared to previous years. Construction diesel use was reduced due to the slower development rate and by switching from diesel generators to grid electricity at the earliest opportunity. In the year ended 31 March 2012, Big Yellow plans to continue its energy efficiency programme for store lighting and increased capacity for solar PV installations (providing up to 50 kWp) on new stores. We aim to reduce carbon intensity per square metre of occupied space by 2.5%, as our	50	25

From the early Earth Summits to more recent UK environmental legislation, international control measures have been set in place to change behaviour. The aim of this legislation is to reduce the impact of mans activities on the planets life support systems. These delicate and complex systems include the finite resources of our land, atmosphere, oceans, soils and biodiversity.	63	3
Big Yellow Group	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2012.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/b/LSE_BYG_2012.pdf	BigYellowGroup-2012.pdf	One of the most significant impacts is the exploitation of fossil fuels and their emissions into the atmosphere. Consensus of opinion is that our global climate is changing due to the accumulation of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions in the earth'atmosphere. This is also known as 'global warming' and is one of the main environmental and social drivers for Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainable Development as addressed in our CSR Policy.	63	4

KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS Big Yellows most significant environmental impact is its carbon emissions from electric lighting use in operational stores. Approximately 97% of the store area does not require either heating or cooling due to adequate insulation, air tightness and top floor ventilation. Only the public reception area requires heating and cooling for staff and customer comfort levels. We have calculated carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions using the latest Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) conversion factors: 2011 DEFRA / DECCs GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting Version 1.2, 19/08/2011.	63	22
Big Yellow Group	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2012.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/b/LSE_BYG_2012.pdf	BigYellowGroup-2012.pdf	We have also included total electricity cost including VAT and the Climate Change Levy (CCL), where appropriate, to assess the reduction of kWh consumption in terms of total savings from energy use. Corporate Social Responsibility Report (continued) 05 Corporate Social Responsibility Report (continued) 4. KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS (continued) 4.1 Store energy use carbon dioxide emissions Independent energy statements estimate that about 60% of our store electricity is consumed by lighting. Approximately 30% of our total electricity use is by lifts. Approximately 3% of our store electricity is used in external signage, security and parking. The remainder is used for reception area heating and cooling. Carbon emissions from these power station sources are known as Scope 2, indirect offsite emissions. The table below summarises the Groups store electricity usage, costs and emissions over the last three years:	63	23

CRC tax savings of 1,000 (12/tCO2) will be achieved from this electricity reduction. The reporting of electricity use estimates has now been reduced to minimum by the use of automatic meter reading (AMR) devices. DEFRA Conversion Factors for Company Reporting 2011 states that the increased import of overseas electricity included more renewable and nuclear energy. This has contributed to our lower carbon emissions, through the use of the lower electricity to carbon conversion factor compared to last financial year. Carbon intensity emissions for self storage occupied space reduced significantly (18.6%), against increasing customer numbers. The carbon intensity measure for gross internal area (GIA) takes into account our new store portfolio growth (we opened three new stores at Eltham,	63	25

In the new financial year our targets will be to continue absolute carbon reduction and carbon intensity reduction through our continued energy efficient re-lamping programmes and our increasing investments in solar electricity generation. 4.2 Store lighting energy efficiency programmes Our three new stores at Eltham, Stockport and New Cross have energy saving motion sensor lighting, T5 energy efficient lamps and external LED lighting, installed by Big Yellow Construction. Facilities Management installed zoning of the existing motion-sensor lighting (MSL) at eight stores: Cheltenham, Croydon; Leeds; New Malden; Portsmouth; Slough; Staples Corner; and Twickenham, to increase the efficient use of electricity and reduce carbon emissions. We now have nine stores upgraded to MSL, including Bow. further four stores were re-lamped by Facilities Management	63	26
Big Yellow Group	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2012.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/b/LSE_BYG_2012.pdf	BigYellowGroup-2012.pdf	with Power Saver lamps at Beckenham, Byfleet, Milton Keynes and Staples Corner. This brings the total number of stores with energy efficient T5 or Power Saver Lamps, in the whole portfolio to 30 stores. Our strategy for the store portfolio has been progressed by Facilities Management who are currently trialling LED lighting for internal storage and reception use at our Slough store. Initial performance monitoring shows energy savings of around 60% efficiency compared to conventional T8 switched-start fittings. With the possible installation of LEDs during 2012, the Power Saver re-lamping programme will potentially be replaced with the more efficient LED investment. 4.3 Stores gas use carbon dioxide emissions Flexi-office services are provided alongside self storage in twelve of our sixty five stores.

INTRODUCTION (continued) Scope 2 Carbon Emissions: Indirect (off-site) GHG carbon equivalent emissions from electricity supplied for store lighting use in all areas of the building; and air conditioning for store reception areas only. Our main business activities consist of self storage operations and the facilities management of 66 store portfolio. National grid electricity use constitutes 93.8% of our annual energy consumption, mainly for store lighting (both internal and external). It is major operational cost and our most significant environmental impact, so we have continued with our investment in energy efficient lighting programmes to assist in reducing our Scope 2 emissions in the last year.	79	18

Waste recycling and landfill GHG emissions Waste generation in self storage is assessed as low environmental impact as customers store high value goods and generate very little waste. Customer waste is the responsibility of our customers, unless recycling services are requested at an individual store. The majority of Big Yellows non-hazardous bulk office waste is segregated by staff and recycled by our waste contractor. Waste tonnage is measured by our contractor from bulk container volumes. Percentages of waste recycled or sent to land fill is determined from studies and estimates. Water supply and waste water treatment GHG emissions Water use measurement has been monitored over the last three years (with some estimation) to confirm the significance of this potential	79	19

It has been assessed as low environmental impact for self storage operations, but Big Yellow will continue to monitor and report this data to assess tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) for water supply chain sewage treatment emissions. 2. ENERGY USE, GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND SOLAR ELECTRICITY GENERATION Key performance indicators for annual energy use and GHG emissions In reporting our total carbon footprint from emissions we express our total energy use, including Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions from National Grid supplied electricity, natural gas, gas oil, diesel and self generated solar electricity as kWh and compare their significance as percentages of our total use.

Electricity supplied from the National Grid currently accounts for 93.8% of our energy use for store lighting (c. 60% of store energy use) and reception area air conditioning (c. 30% of store energy use). Only 4.6% of energy use is from natural gas heating for our flexi-offices. Absolute energy use increased in 2013 due to increased customer occupancy, one new store opening (Chiswick), the expansion of storage space at 7 stores (phase 2 fit out works), and an increased demand for flexi-office winter heating. However, reduction in energy use of 0.9% was still achieved in 2013, compared to the average energy use over the last two years (14,661,987 kWh), method used by carbon reduction certification bodies. This reduction was due to our	79	21

See page 54 for the independent assurance report. Average annual solar electricity generation for the years ended 31 March 2011 and 2012 was 118,727 kWh, indicating an increase in solar electricity of 74.4% in 2013. Solar electricity now contributes 7.4% of our total electricity use in the 15 stores with solar installations and benefits Big Yellow as it displaces 5-20% of our grid electricity supply at those stores. Solar generation reduces our grid electricity dependency and our carbon tax. It also increases cost savings and generates revenue. The solar electricity generation achievements have been as follows: 1.	79	32

The CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme is designed to cut emissions in large private sector organisations. This legislation started in 2011 with broad assessment of energy uses including electricity and gas. The scheme uses carbon dioxide conversion factor, and so is not directly comparable to the Companies Act GHG equivalent reporting. The current CRC tax is 12 per ton of CO2 and this will rise to 13 per ton in the year ending 31 March 2015. This year, our CRC taxation will reduce in	63	43

Big Yellow is required to comply with the ESOS scheme as we are large undertaking (> 250+ employees) and have an annual turnover of > 50 million. We have appointed an accredited assessor, measured all our energy consumption, determined significant areas of use and will complete the audit before December 2015.

The current CRC Tax Rate has risen from 12.00 to 16.40 per ton of CO2 for 2015; this will rise again in 2016 to 16.90/tCO2). The CRC is another financial driver for energy and carbon emission reductions and for investing in energy efficient technologies. From 2013, we have reduced CRC tCO2 carbon emissions by 37% and an average of 18.5% per year and are reducing CRC tax payments against future increase in the tax rate.

Considering approximately 95% of our material energy use is Grid supplied electricity, we can estimate an absolute carbon reduction from 2008, of 27%. We can also estimate over the last seven years, an annual average reduction of approximately 4% per year. The UK commercial property sector Real Estate Environmental Benchmark recommends 3.5% annual reduction target to align with the Governments 2050 goal set in 2008. Our more immediate target is to reduce emissions by 34% by 2020. Last year we set programme target to reduce electricity and GHG tCO2e by 12 %.

It was the third year of our partnership and we staged 5K and 10K runs in Sunderland, London, Worcester, Cardiff, Bristol and the Isle of Man, where many hundreds of men and boys pulled their giant Go Dad Run-fronts on over their shorts, to take part and raise funds for Prostate Cancer UK-and to raise awareness of important men'health issues. Our friends and colleagues at Big Yellow Self Storage were essential to helping us to make that happen.	111	18

Financial Risks and Opportunities of Climate Change The financial risks and opportunities of Climate Change are within the cost of sustainable planning, designing and constructing of our new store developments, which can be more sustainable and resilient in the longer term. The financial risks involve reviewing the existing and acquired stores against extreme weather events such as seasonal storms and flooding. Our investors also appreciate disclosures and performance benchmarks of our portfolio set against sustainable development and energy efficiency benchmarks to assess our annual	111	78

Internal regulatory briefs on compliance and high standards within real estate benchmarks, makes Big Yellow an efficient and low risk investment. Physical Risks and Opportunities The physical risks from increased GHG emission is climate change, global warming, and the consequences of higher risk weather systems that can increase temperatures, storm frequency, flooding and/or droughts. Big Yellow has physically invested in energy efficiency in order to reduce electricity use and GHG emission. Our solar stores have customer facing electronic screens displaying real time solar generation (kWh) and carbon emissions (tCO2) saved in customer reception areas. Big Yellow has also trialled and invested in green roofs and green walls on several of our stores (Barking, Chiswick, Fulham, High Wycombe and Sutton) in the urban areas of our towns and cities. These investments provide shade to our stores in the summer that are susceptible	111	79

Green roofs can store moisture after rainfall that evaporates in the spring and summer seasons and cools the upper floor levels. Rainwater Harvesting Systems are also installed (Barking, Chiswick, Liverpool, Merton, Sheffield and Sutton) in order to provide landscape irrigation in the summer months. Several stores have sustainable urban drainage systems that provide permeable car park surfaces or peripheral soft landscaping that can regulate surface water to ground waters and local rivers.	111	80

Our store staff apply best practice waste segregation for general and mixed dry recyclable materials. Waste Recycling Contractor Our recycling contractor provides further segregation and recycling of our waste. Since our total waste benchmark of 2011 (244) our store portfolio has increased from 62 to 73 stores, and total waste has increased to 325.1 in 2017, an increase of 33% from 2011. The percentage of waste recycled has reduced from 73% in 2013 to 59% in 2017. This reduction in our contractors recycling is an increasing trend	111	88
Big Yellow Group	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2017.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/b/LSE_BYG_2017.pdf	BigYellowGroup-2017.pdf	due to reduction in the supply price of some mixed dry recycled materials, such as paper and cardboard. Waste to Landfill and Landfill Tax An increasing amount of General waste, 130 tonnes (41% of general waste) went to landfill in 2017, as compared to 69 tonnes (28% of general waste) in 2011, an increase of 53% over six years. Landfill Tax is an environmental tax paid in addition to normal landfill costs.	111	89

If no segregation or recycling occurs, an increase in the tax to 84.40 per ton can apply to more active waste. These changes have increased our landfill tax by 32%, mainly due to the reduction in the market value of our recyclate that is now sent to landfill due to its low price.	111	90

History Between 2008 and 2017 we installed first internal, later external, LED lighting in many of our stores and renewable energy initiatives were included in our new stores, such as solar panels (as of 12.03.2018 on 18 stores), and ground source heat pumps (in five stores) and these achieved both electricity use reduction and sustainable electricity generation across our store portfolio.	234	96
Big Yellow Group	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2018.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/b/LSE_BYG_2018.pdf	BigYellowGroup-2018.pdf	Electricity use is driven by quantifiable factors such as new stores openings, the provision of flexi offices at certain stores and increasing customer occupancy. Electricity use is also driven by more variable aspects of our business, such as frequency of customers accessing our stores (and triggering motion sensor lighting) and the number of business customers in store who may make use of electrical socket supply in our stores.	234	97

The Waste to Landfill number is calculated by subtracting from the General Waste number our contractors mass balance figure.

During 2016/17 we failed to subtract that mass balance figure so have corrected the data this year.

Big Yellow Group	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2018.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/b/LSE_BYG_2018.pdf	BigYellowGroup-2018.pdf	Landfill Tax is an environmental tax paid in addition to normal landfill costs. Reducing, re-using and recycling waste can reduce the Landfill Tax rate to 2.65 per ton (for more inert waste). If no segregation or recycling occurs, an increase in the tax to 84.40 per ton can apply to more active waste. These changes have increased our landfill tax by 32%, mainly due to the reduction in the market value of our recyclate that is now sent to landfill due to its low price.	234	147

From 2010 to 2013 we had an increase in electricity use as result of our new store openings and increased customer occupancy.	234	190
Big Yellow Group	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2018.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/b/LSE_BYG_2018.pdf	BigYellowGroup-2018.pdf	This increase in our emissions delayed the achievement of our 2008 to 2012 Kyoto Protocol Reduction Target of 12.5% until 2014. The UK Climate Change Act (2008) The Climate Change Act was made legally binding in the 2009 April Budget. It has an interim target of GHG Emission reduction of 34% by 2020. The longer-term target is to reduce GHG Emission by 80% by 2050 (or by approximately 3.5% per year). 13 Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS) Drainage systems can contribute to sustainable development and improve the places and spaces where we live, work and play by balancing the different opportunities and challenges that influence urban design and the development of communities. Approaches to manage surface water that take account of water quantity (flooding), water quality (pollution) biodiversity (wildlife and plants) and amenity are	234	191

SuDS mimic nature and typically manage rainfall close to where it falls. SuDS can be designed to transport (convey) surface water, slow runoff down (attenuate) before it enters watercourses, they provide areas to store water in natural contours and can be used to allow water to soak (infiltrate) into the ground or evaporated from surface water and lost or transpired from vegetation (known as evapotranspiration).	234	192
Big Yellow Group	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2018.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/b/LSE_BYG_2018.pdf	BigYellowGroup-2018.pdf	SUDS are drainage systems that are considered to be environmentally beneficial, causing minimal or no long-term detrimental damage. They are often regarded as sequence of management practices, control structures and strategies designed to efficiently and sustainably drain surface water, while minimising pollution and managing the impact on water quality of local water bodies.	234	193

Big Yellow Group	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2018.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/b/LSE_BYG_2018.pdf	BigYellowGroup-2018.pdf	We have been engaged by Big Yellow to perform limited assurance procedures on selected Group level Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) performance indicators (the Subject Matter) for the year ended 31 March 2018.

Big Yellow Group	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2018.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/b/LSE_BYG_2018.pdf	BigYellowGroup-2018.pdf	To achieve limited assurance ISAE 3000 requires that we review the processes and systems used to compile the areas on which we provide assurance. This standard requires that we comply with the independence and ethical requirements and to plan and perform our assurance engagement to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence on which to base our limited assurance conclusion. It does not include detailed testing of source data or the operating effectiveness of processes and internal controls. This is designed to give similar level of assurance to that obtained in the review of interim financial information. This provides less assurance and is substantially less in scope than reasonable assurance engagement.	234	212

We consider them key as we interact with each other numerous times throughout our days, so we want these interactions to be positive. We do that by making sure we understand what matters to them so we can meet their needs. This is important to us, so we have mechanisms in place to allow us to gather their thoughts, for example through our employee and customer surveys.	259	30
Big Yellow Group	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2019.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReports/PDF/LSE_BYG_2019.pdf	BigYellowGroup-2019.pdf	We are also giving significant considerations to three other stakeholder groups, namely our investor community, local government including local planning; and national / international bodies.

During this time, the focus of sustainability strategy was to assess and minimise the impact our operations have on the environment and other stakeholder groups. Our CSR Reports up until 2017 reflected this and we continue to be committed to minimising our impacts.	259	32
Big Yellow Group	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2019.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReports/PDF/LSE_BYG_2019.pdf	BigYellowGroup-2019.pdf	The world around us has changed climate change is new reality that we are having to deal with. Understanding how changing environment impacts on our business as set out by the recommendations for the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) for example has introduced other approaches to setting long-term, impactful strategy. Extreme weather events and Once in Lifetime natural disasters are happening with greater frequency and severity. Awareness of specific topics, such as single-use plastic, have risen quickly to the top of most of companies agendas, including ours.	259	33
Big Yellow Group	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2019.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReports/PDF/LSE_BYG_2019.pdf	BigYellowGroup-2019.pdf	How do we define what matters? We define what matters by looking firstly at the magnitude of the impact we have as business on social and environmental aspects; and secondly by looking at the magnitude climate change related aspects have on our business. The first priority has remained unchanged over the many years we have been doing business. The materiality assessment we last conducted in 2007, as consequence, has needed little formal review; instead we have been gathering stakeholder feedback, both formally and informally, and incorporating changing needs as we grew. Over the last 10 years or so we have seen rise in public consciousness of single-use plastic and climate change (and resulting regulation and taxes), the move of certain technologies into mainstream (for example Solar PV) and we have noted with concern the	259	34
Big Yellow Group	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2019.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReports/PDF/LSE_BYG_2019.pdf	BigYellowGroup-2019.pdf	increasing numbers of individuals who lack opportunities to access work, such as ex-offenders, refugees, veterans and individuals with disabilities. We understand that it is good practice to conduct refreshed materiality assessment every few years, to ensure stakeholder expectations are being met. However, the current urgency of addressing climate change and ensuring society is resilient enough to deal with its impacts means it is time to take focussed action on what we know needs to be done.	259	35
Big Yellow Group	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2019.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReports/PDF/LSE_BYG_2019.pdf	BigYellowGroup-2019.pdf	We commit to undertake continuous reviews of our business and will trigger more formal materiality assessment in the event of material changes to our business and / or material change in external aspects affecting our business.

Our most frequent incidents happen when our customers move and stack their possessions, not heeding safety considerations, such as wearing gloves. We place posters and notices throughout our stores to remind our customers to take sensible measures. We keep well stocked first aid kits in our stores to deal with small cuts and scrapes and report all incidents via our&reporting procedure so we can assess and address where possible the root causes of any injury.	259	110

These investments provide shade to our stores in the summer that are susceptible to the urban heat island effect and form part of our mitigation and adaptation initiatives. Green roofs can store moisture after rainfall that evaporates in the spring and summer seasons and cools the upper floor levels. Rainwater Harvesting Systems are also installed (Barking, Chiswick, Liverpool, Merton, Sheffield and Sutton) to provide landscape irrigation in the summer months.	259	198

Having upgraded the common parts of our stores with LED lighting some years ago, our opportunities have become little limited. The main grid electricity saving opportunity identified by the assessor is the retrofitting and continued commitment to solar PV on existing and new store portfolio. We do consider this valuable suggestion and will continue to consider solar PV, however it is worth remembering that the physical location as well as the structure / position of the roofs of individual stores may not lend themselves to solar PV.	259	211

Managing Risks and Opportunities (continued) Our initial assessments identified number of potential risks, which we are committed to exploring further: 1. The impact of rising temperatures / warmer climate on our existing store portfolio It seems that currently the projected average temperature changes in both two and four degree warming scenarios. In the four degree warming scenario, average temperature rises over 14 degrees. This will mean warmer winters but very hot summers. We have found that, although an increase in average temperature is likely to affect our operational costs of cooling and heating, we do not expect this to be in financially material way. We anticipate the requirements for cooling to increase, but with less heating, costs are expected to broadly cancel each other out.	259	216
Big Yellow Group	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2019.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReports/PDF/LSE_BYG_2019.pdf	BigYellowGroup-2019.pdf	As only small part of our stores are either heated or cooled, it will be important to understand the impact an increase in ambient temperature has on goods stored and frequent storage users (such as business customers who use their storage to conduct aspects of work). Our store area ventilation kicks in at 23 degrees centigrade; but were uncertain what impact extended periods of extreme heat will have on our ability to keep temperatures pleasant in our storage areas.	259	217
Big Yellow Group	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2019.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReports/PDF/LSE_BYG_2019.pdf	BigYellowGroup-2019.pdf	We plan to monitor ambient temperature changes over the next few years (to 2025) in our stores and engage with external experts to understand our options for mitigation, should that be necessary. Action: Actively monitor and assess 2. The impact of more frequent and severe storms producing large amount of water in short time frame on our existing store portfolio In the period up to 2030, the risks of natural hazards are unlikely to increase in material way as direct result of climate change. Natural weather variability will continue, which means storms and flooding could continue to affect our assets. Although we do not expect dramatic increase in instances in the next 10 years, nevertheless the impact of excess water (i.e. localised flooding or storms) is quite high. With current knowledge, we also have good visibility of	259	218
Big Yellow Group	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2019.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReports/PDF/LSE_BYG_2019.pdf	BigYellowGroup-2019.pdf	localised vulnerability and are therefore reviewing our current locations, and actively look at adaptation opportunities where necessary. For example, we opened our Sheffield Bramall Lane store after the City floods of 2008; as result we built up the base level of our store by further 500mm to ensure our storage would stay dry if similar (or even greater) flooding was to be repeated. Another current mitigation strategy is Urban Sustainable Drainage which can be implemented where necessary. number of our stores features slightly raised ground floor (as mentioned above) or adjusted levels in our car parks to minimise the damage caused by local street flooding.	259	219
Big Yellow Group	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2019.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReports/PDF/LSE_BYG_2019.pdf	BigYellowGroup-2019.pdf	We may also experience an increase in our Facilities costs if we are repairing storm damage and ensuring our customers belongings remain safe and dry and shielded from storms and other natural events. We have detailed and ongoing visual inspections of each of our stores: our staff conduct daily walks of the premises to identify any maintenance needs as quickly as possible. Our Directors also conduct yearly walk arounds of each store on their annual store tours. During the latter, more significant projects are discussed and agreed. We plan on assessing financial impacts to remedy or mitigate climate change related aspects and embed these into our budgets in future years.	259	220

Impact of changing legislation on our business and Construction We expect planning obligations to increasingly focus on addressing localised climate-related hazards: such as avoiding urban heat islands and adequate urban drainage systems, as well as enabling the transition to low carbon economy through the installation of on-site renewables, Electric Vehicle (EV) charging points etc. We expect additional costs per build to incorporate these features.	259	221

We work very closely with local planners, consultants and experts to ensure our buildings are efficient, resilient and meet or exceed planning regulations. At present, we expect any specific extra requirement to be absorbed into the overall cost. At this point in time we do not foresee material financial cost that cannot be absorbed into the overall project.	259	222

Digital Realtys Houston Campus remained above floodwaters, accessible and operational throughout the storm and afterwards. In 2012, Digital Realty maintained 100% uptime at 15 data centers in the path of Superstorm Sandy and the Noreaster that followed. The portfolio impacted by the storm spanned seven states, from North Carolina to Massachusetts. Our focus on resilience, from acquisitions through operations, reflects this commitment, and our track record of uptime shows why Digital Realty is trusted foundation for the modern world. Our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K (2018 10-K) identified potential financial implications of climate change to our business. These potential risks include: Higher energy costs (e.g., due to more extreme weather events, extreme temperatures or increased demand for limited resources)	105	23

We utilize live maps of our global portfolio to identify data centers that may be at risk of natural hazards such as rainfall, snowfall, temperature, wind, hail and floods, and we can view which properties are near 100-year and 500-year flood zones. Based on our analyses of physical risks from climate change, floods and wind storms pose the greatest financial risk to our business operations. Risk reports are developed for each data center to include prevention recommendations specific to each identified risk. We also assess our exposure to social risks such as physical security, cybersecurity and pandemics.	105	29

The Plans are reviewed and tested on an annual basis. Indirect Risk In addition to the direct risks to our data center portfolio related to extreme weather and climate change, we recognize the potential for indirect customer and investor risk as well. Many of our customers and investors hold sustainable values and standards, and we understand that if we do not operate in sustainable manner, we run the financial risk of reduced customer retention and diminished shareholder base.	105	32

PRIORITIZING RENEWABLE SUPPLY Our approach prioritizes cost-competitive net-new renewable energy sourced within the same grid regions where our data centers are located. While we generally prefer renewable energy be delivered through local utility partners, we recognize that this is not feasible in many markets today, either at the scale we need or in the time-frame we seek to act. We assess the carbon reduction impact our projects will have on the regional grid and seek to maximize carbon reductions whenever possible by supporting projects in higher carbon-intensity grids. While we generally prefer to minimize the use of unbundled commodity Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) to meet our long-term targets, we have purchased RECs in the past and may continue to do so as conditions warrant.	105	44

Chronic Long-term climate impacts may pose several risks to our portfolio. More extreme weather events and extreme temperatures may lead to higher and more volatile energy costs; severe droughts may lead to higher water costs; air quality impacts related to forest fires could affect operational resilience; extreme rainfall events could exacerbate the risk of localized flooding and water ingress at buildings; sea level rise could increase the risk of flooding for small number of assets. These impacts may contribute to increased insurance premiums, incremental planning and prevention costs, and costs to limit or further harden assets to resist these	121	23

These impacts could also drive customer preferences for certain markets and away from others. Transition Risks Policy and Legal Increased environmental regulations may increase the cost to develop or the ability to develop in certain areas. To lesser extent, regulatory changes may increase administrative requirements for reporting and compliance. Building codes are expected to become more stringent over time, potentially increasing development costs and requiring the adoption of new and different technologies.	121	24
Digital Realty Trust Inc.	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2019.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReports/PDF/NYSE_DLR_2019.pdf	DigitalRealtyTrustInc.-2019.pdf	Technology Current products and materials may become obsolete more quickly than anticipated or may be replaced with lower-carbon technologies, which could result in increased construction costs. We expect the sophistication of our building systems and controls will become more advanced over time, which may lead to increased construction and operational costs. We may see varying levels of customer acceptance of newer technologies. Market Our customers may choose data centers in markets where utility costs are lower or where the utility grid has lower emissions which could result in accelerated obsolescence of certain assets. Disruptions in the supply chains of building materials and data center infrastructure may extend construction times or increase construction costs. Higher costs for energy and water may influence customer leasing decisions. Reputational Data centers consume significant amounts of energy and the associated	121	25
Digital Realty Trust Inc.	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2019.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReports/PDF/NYSE_DLR_2019.pdf	DigitalRealtyTrustInc.-2019.pdf	emissions contribute to climate change. Customers and investors may increase their scrutiny of data centers, encouraging increased investment in cleaner renewable energy solutions and low-carbon technologies and diversifying away from more carbon-intensive properties and portfolios. We may face scrutiny by local communities, NGOs, and regulators but at this time we do not believe we are exposed to material litigation risk due to climate change.

Employee-focused health, wellness, and engagement programs may improve workforce satisfaction and lead to reduced costs related to employee turnover. Energy Source Transitioning to low-emission sources of energy and investing in new renewable solutions have the potential to lower our operating expenses and may reduce our data centers exposure to potential future carbon regulations, fees, or taxes. Additionally, we have the opportunity to generate incremental revenues by developing renewable products and solutions for customers. Products and Services Our sustainably certified data centers may result in increased customer demand and retention, reflecting consumer preferences for lower-carbon buildings. This may also result in reduced insurance premiums.

Markets Our globally diversified portfolio enables us to take advantage of broad range of utility incentives and renewable and low-carbon energy products that become available. We have the opportunity to pursue green bond offerings, such as our first green bond in 2015, our second in 2019, and our third offering in 2020 (see Green Bonds section), which further diversifies our pool of investors and expands our ability to access capital to cost-effectively fund the growth of our business.

IMPACT OF RISKS ON BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PLANNING We consider exposure to weather events, flooding, and climate change at the time of acquisitions, development, and regularly throughout the operational phase of our properties. We evaluate portfolio concentration and related geographic risks as part of our enterprise risk management program. We evaluate energy and water conservation opportunities annually as part of each assets capital plan, and our energy supply chain team affirmatively solicits and evaluates low carbon and renewable energy options when sourcing energy. To manage reputational and regulatory risks, we have continued our commitment to developing green buildings that seek to minimize impacts on the communities where we operate expanding our supply	121	29

We will proactively seek the required financial information to undertake long-term financial impact modelling and expect to evaluate the resilience of our strategy in light of differing climate scenarios in the years ahead. Digital Realty ESG Report 2019 | Operational and Climate Change Resilience | Page 18 Risk Management PROCESS FOR ASSESSING AND IDENTIFYING CLIMATE RISKS Our Risk Management team assesses range of risks for all of our assets, from the time of acquisition, during the construction process and annually throughout each propertys operational lifecycle. Sensitivity analyses and stress-testing are performed primarily to identify changes in financial risks. Our insurance providers have developed Resilience Index to evaluate risk across our data centers,	121	30
Digital Realty Trust Inc.

We utilize live maps of our global portfolio to identify data centers that may be at risk of natural hazards such as rainfall, snowfall, temperature, wind, hail and floods, and we can view which properties are near 100-year and 500-year flood zones. Based on our analyses of physical risks from climate change, floods and pose the greatest financial risk to our business operations. Risk reports are developed for each data center to include prevention recommendations specific to each identified risk. We also assess our exposure to social risks such as physical security, cybersecurity and pandemics.	121	31

We maintain appropriate levels of insurance for each asset. For each property, our Risk Management team receives reports from insurance providers that identify opportunities to enhance protection for each facility and improve loss expectancy values. We annually measure the reductions in value-at-risk achieved through the implementation of these measures. We ensure each site has mitigation plans in place specific to its location and exposure to climate risk. Our global Operations team actively implements and refines operating procedures to ensure our data centers are safe and resilient. This includes regular emergency response plan updates and other	121	32

These efforts will help enhance water supply resilience, improve visibility into water-utilizing systems via expanded submetering and monitoring, reduce water consumption through innovative treatment programs and extend asset life. As part of this effort, the Operations and EOH&teams developed Global Water Strategy and Policy which addresses the strategic role that water plays in our operations, identifies regions where water	121	65

(Actual payback period will depend upon the cost of electricity, hours per day of electricity usage and the availability of cost-offsetting, energy-savings incentive programs.) In addition, T5 and T8 lights are rust-free, dust-and moisture-resistant, and easy to clean. ProLogis outfitted approximately 2.5 million square feet of combined new and existing space with high-effi-ciency lights during 2006. Our experience so far has shown that electricity consumption may be reduced by up to 75% with these fluorescent lighting systems. Due to the overwhelming success of this program, we have now made T5/T8 lights available in all new buildings in North America.

Sustainable Warehouse Initiatives Early in 2008, ProLogis announced two important sustainable development initiatives. We pledged to develop all new warehouses in the United States to envi-ronmental standards developed by the USGBC and to register each building with the USGBC for certification under LEED, the.S. national standard for environmen-tally responsible construction. Additionally, we plan to develop all new warehouses in the United Kingdom to BREEAM standards developed by BRE Global.	96	32
Prologis	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2007.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/p/NYSE_PLD_2007.pdf	Prologis-2007.pdf	These initiatives impact all new development currently in the design or planning stage, as well as future projects in the United States and the United Kingdom. In an increasing number of global markets, regulators are adopting policies that provide preferential permit-ting treatment for those development projects that will comply with leading environmental standards, creating an advantage for the frontrunners. Our facilities will not only provide options for our customers that are interested in furthering their own sustainability initia-tives and reducing energy consumption, but we believe that as customer demand grows, these high-performance buildings will lease more quickly and generate higher rents and greater return on investment.	96	33

At ProLogis, this concept incorporates business excellence, environmental stewardship and corporate social responsibility, which gives our sustainability initiative triple bottom line: benefit to the planet, to people and to the profitability that makes our existence possible. Embracing this definition commits us to making progress on all three fronts at the same time, and not one at the expense of others.	186	16
Prologis	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2008.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/p/NYSE_PLD_2008.pdf	Prologis-2008.pdf	With that in mind, believe it is important to recognize the vastly different landscape the industry is facing after last years disruption in the credit markets and global economic recession. This change of events has had dramatic impact on companies worldwide, and ProLogis has not been immune. In November of 2008, we had change in the CEO role. My predecessor was key driver behind our rapid growth and international expansion. However, as most companies are doing in the current environment, we have had to put our expansion plans on hold. We also have had to make some very tough decisions related to the structure and operations of our company, including selling our China operations and portion of our Japan portfolio, halting new development starts worldwide and reducing our workforce.	186	17

We believe our focus on sustainability not only serves as competitive differentiator but it enables us to establish strategic relationships with customers and partners as well as attract and retain the industrys most talented professionals, all of which ultimately impacts our triple bottom line.	186	18

We undertook the following activities: We conducted interviews with selection of directors and senior managers responsible for areas of management and stakeholder relationships covered by the Report in Denver, CO. The objective of these discussions was to understand ProLogis governance arrangements, stakeholder engagement process, management priorities and systems; We attended meeting of the Sustainability Management Committee to assess the process for identifying and acting on material issues; We conducted general review of issues raised by external parties that could be relevant to ProLogis policies, to provide check on the appropriateness of statements made in the Report; We visited one construction site in Juarez, Mexico.

Site-level sustainability data for January through December 2008 was reviewed during the site visit; We reviewed full 12-month sustainability data collated at the corporate level, and claims made in the Report. We interviewed managers responsible for internal data validation, reviewed their work processes and undertook sample checks on consolidated sustainability data and also sustainability data submitted by the Juarez project site; We undertook an assessment of the companys reporting and management processes against the principles of materiality, completeness and responsiveness as described in the AA1000 Assurance Standard (2003).	186	32

The effort by ProLogis management over the last 18 months to develop more robust materiality assessment is positive example of progress. The next steps for ProLogis will be to link this materiality process to the business decision-making criteria (e.g. through the corporate risk management framework) and also to test the materiality criteria with internal and external stakeholders.	186	35

Nothing came to our attention to suggest that the data included in the Report have not been properly collated and calculated from information reported at operational level. We were unable to verify the authenticity of some source documentation for office energy use at some locations outside of the United States. However, the aggregated value of these un-verified sources is relatively small. Therefore, we consider there to be minimal risk of material mis-statement with regard to carbon emissions.	186	37

However, although ProLogis demonstrates variety of innovative means to inform customers of sustainability initiatives, there is room to improve the mechanisms by which ProLogis hears customer priorities on sustainability issues and how this feedback is systematically evaluated and used to drive stronger decision-making. The result is that customer communication tends to focus on sustainability aspects with clearly demonstrable business case such as lighting upgrades to enhance energy efficiency. Other opportunities such as reducing operational waste that could achieve greater benefits and promote best practice have not been pursued to the same extent.	186	41

Mechanisms to engage with communities during design, build and operation are wide-ranging, but not systematic except where required by local regulatory agencies. We believe that systematic process for community engagement based on proactive dialogue around key issues could add significant value. This process should include mechanisms for active dialogue, metrics to measure success and tools to raise awareness in employees and community members. Such strategic approach could be extended to community investment activities as well, including activities led by the ProLogis Foundation.	186	42

We have seen evidence that ProLogis is seeking expert feedback on sustainability aspects and believe that this is positive step forward in corporate level stakeholder engagement. This type of engagement could be broadened to include expertise on wider range of topics through review panel or similar. Also, it would be valuable to stakeholders if ProLogis would explain how the feedback from expert review will be used to drive systematic decision-making on sustainability aspects.	186	43

Over time, our business strategy evolved to include the development of properties for contribution to property funds in which we maintain an ownership interest and the management of those property funds and the properties they own. Recently, the global financial markets have been undergoing pervasive and fundamental disruptions, which began to impact us late in the third quarter of 2008.

The reconstruction of the pools, which are characterized by their seasonal flooding and drying, has resulted in number of unique and rarely seen plants to reemerge, providing an indication that the restoration is well on its way. To further ensure successful establishment, Catellus agreed to manage and track ecological data at the site for 10 years, after which we will set up an endowment to fund future maintenance by the.S.

We consider these properties to be our Core Properties and refer to them as Completed Development Properties. We also have industrial properties that are currently under development and land available for development, the majority of which we plan to hold and use in this segment.	205	19
Prologis	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2009.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/p/NYSE_PLD_2009.pdf	Prologis-2009.pdf	By retaining more of our development assets, we will improve the geographic diversification of our direct owned properties, as most of our planned develop-ment is in international markets. We expect to resume approximately $700 to $800 million of new development activity in 2010 primarily related to build-to-suit opportunities for customers whose needs are not met by the existing inventory of distribution space. We plan to fund this development activity by generating pro-ceeds through selective sales of primarily US real estate properties and land.	205	20

We were not involved in the preparation of any part of the Report. This is the fourth year that we have provided assurance. We provide recommendations on reporting and stakeholder engagement to ProLogis through the assurance process as well as through separate workshops for management.

Further information, including individual competencies relating to the team can be found at: BASIS OF OUR OPINION In order to form our opinion, we undertook the following activities: We conducted interviews with selection of senior managers responsible for areas of management and stakeholder relationships covered by the Report in Denver, CO. The objective of these discussions was to understand ProLogis governance arrangements, stakeholder engagement process, management priorities and systems; We attended meeting of the Sustainability Management Committee to assess the process for identifying and acting on material issues; We conducted general review of issues raised by external parties that could be relevant to ProLogis policies, to provide check on the appropriateness of statements made in the Report;	205	26
Prologis	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2009.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/p/NYSE_PLD_2009.pdf	Prologis-2009.pdf	We visited one construction site in Oosterhout, Netherlands. During the site visit, we interviewed local management and the contractor company responsible for project management. Site-level sustainability data for January through December 2009 was reviewed during the site visit; We reviewed full 12-month sustainability data collated at the corporate level, and claims made in the Report. We interviewed managers responsible for internal data validation, reviewed their work processes and undertook sample checks on consolidated sustainability data and also sustainability data submitted by the Oosterhout project site; We assessed the company claims with regard to reporting against the GRI G3 voluntary standard for application level.	205	27

Prologis	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2009.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/p/NYSE_PLD_2009.pdf	Prologis-2009.pdf	Report Content Principles MaterialityThe information in report should cover topics and indicators that reflect the organizations significant economic, environmental, and social impacts, or that would substantively influence the assessments and decisions of stakeholders ProLogis provides information against wide range of material issues and it is notable that the ProLogis Report includes discussion of social, environmental and economic corporate responsibility aspects. We also note that ProLogis has undertaken systematic process to assess materiality for the companyalthough this is not described in great detail within the Report. In the future, we recommend that ProLogis assess the materiality of lobbying practices of the trade groups in which the company is member as well as topics around employee health, safety and well-being.	205	29

Of particular note are efforts to understand and make effective decisions from employee and customer feedback. We also note the positive movement to develop Community Engagement Strategy in 2009, with implementation in 2010. We look forward to the implementation of the strategy, specifically the challenge of creating engagement mechanisms that are more effective in promoting open dialogue between ProLogis and its communities.	205	30
Prologis	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2009.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/p/NYSE_PLD_2009.pdf	Prologis-2009.pdf	Sustainability ContextThe report should present the organizations performance in the wider context of sustainability We have no reason to believe that the ProLogis Report does not present proper context of sustainability. However, we recommend that the discussion of risk management processes in future reports makes more explicit link to corporate responsibility decision-making criteria (e.g. the criteria incorporated into the ProLogis materiality process).	205	31

Nothing came to our attention to indicate that the Report is not complete reflection of the material corporate responsibility aspects faced by ProLogis.	205	32
Prologis	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2009.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/p/NYSE_PLD_2009.pdf	Prologis-2009.pdf	Report Quality Principles Against the Report Quality Principles of Reliability, Accuracy, Clarity, Balance, Comparability and Timeliness, we offer the following observations and recom-mendations: (definitions available at G3Online/DefiningReportQuality/) In terms of Comparability, ProLogis shows strong year on year reporting of key performance indicators including explanations of significant changes in performance and trends. To provide better context, we recommend that more systematic benchmarks be reported along with performance data.	205	33

However, the seminal events that led to one of the worst financial meltdowns in history have led to sig-nificant changes at ProLogis. The structure and operations of our company have changed over the past 18 months, and as result, our new construction activity has been very limited. And after selling our assets in China, as well as 20 percent interest in Japanese property funds [2.9], we recalculated our carbon footprint for 2007 and 2008 (the first two years we calculated global footprint) given our new operational structure in Asia.	205	36

Methodology for Calculations and Measurements ENERGY AND CARBON EnergyOur preferred approach to understanding our energy consumption is to obtain utility bills from our offices local utility company. If the utility account is specific to our office, then these bills allow us to understand energy consumption without any estimation.	205	40
Prologis	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2009.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/p/NYSE_PLD_2009.pdf	Prologis-2009.pdf	If our office is part of larger building and we do not have our own energy meters, then we try to obtain energy bills for the entire building (typically from third-party landlord). We assume our energy consumption is proportional to the amount of square footage we occupy. For example, if we occupy 10 percent of building, we assume 10 percent of the buildings energy consumption is associ-ated with our operations.	205	41

Listed below are few methods we use to help increase the energy efficiency of our buildings. ENERGY PERFORMANCE CERTIFICATES [EN6] The Europe Union (EU) is now requiring buildings to receive an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC). This is public rating indicating buildings energy efficiency. Each country in the EU has developed its own rating system, but in all cases the EPC rating compares building energy efficiency to govern-ment-defined baseline. Thus far, our buildings are rating 25 to 50 percent more efficient than national baselines, significantly reducing our customers energy costs and consumption. This government verification of efficiency clearly demon-strates the financial and environmental benefits of our buildings.	205	94

The estimated carbon savings achieved with these facilities is more than 210,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent. This is equal to the emissions annually generated by more than 62,000 American homes. DOE PROGRAM [EN6] In the fall of 2008, the.S. Department of Energy (DOE) awarded approxi-mately $15 million for new, national study to speed market adoption of current technologies and design solutions that yield significant, measurable energy sav-ings for commercial buildings.	205	95

The project selected was the Cape May, New Jersey, municipal landfill in the United States. Decomposing trash at the landfill releases methane, greenhouse gas that is much more potent than carbon dioxide. The landfill captures this gas so that it is not released into the environment, creating carbon offsets available for purchase that are additional, permanent and verified.	205	118

We plan to take similar approach to offsetting our 2009 carbon footprint. CARBON FOOTPRINT REDUCTION Operational Carbon [EN5] While purchasing carbon offsets is one way to mitigate our impact on climate change, we also believe it is important to directly reduce our emissions as much as possible. That is why, in 2009, we established goal for reducing our operational carbon emissions: 10 percent reduction per million square feet of global real estate portfolio by 2012, from our 2007 baseline.	205	122

That is why we continue to study the embodied carbon that is captured in our development projects. Embodied carbon is the carbon associated with the life-cycle of warehouse development, beginning with extraction of raw materials to make building components, the manufactur-ing of the materials and their transport to the site, the energy consumed during construction, and finally, the demolition and waste management at the end of the buildings life. By partnering with our suppliers on select projects, we have been able to reduce percentage of the buildings embodied carbon footprint. And in cases where our customers share commitment to mitigating climate change, we	205	124

For example, in 2009 we completed build-to-suit project in the.K. for Royal Mail, 213,000-square-foot mail sorting and distribution facility. Separate from taking many steps to minimize the facilitys operational energy consumption, we also conducted life-cycle study to manage the carbon emis-sions associated with building construction, maintenance and demolition. We call this embodied carbon since these emissions are embodied in the structure itself, before light switch is even turned on.	205	125
Prologis	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2009.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/p/NYSE_PLD_2009.pdf	Prologis-2009.pdf	Our approach included working with suppliers that provided low-carbon products by minimizing the emissions during product manufacturing. Our contractors used fuel-efficient construction equipment, and we used locally sourced materials to minimize transportation and fuel consumption. These efforts lowered the embod-ied carbon of the building by approximately 25 percent. The remaining embodied carbon was offset with carbon credits (i.e., reduction in emissions achieved elsewhere) generated by ProLogis. Several years ago, we capped sewage treatment area that was producing methanea potent green-house gas emitted by decomposing waste. This capping prevented the methane from being released into the atmosphere. third-party consultant measured and verified the quantity of emissions avoided, thus generating carbon credits we could use to offset the emissions of the Royal Mail project.	205	126

We strive to work with these parties on sustainability matters but their activities fall outside our boundary for performance data reporting. Prologis does not report on the business activities of entities where we do not have direct operational control: our co-investment partners, joint venture partners, service providers, customers, contractors, suppliers and vendors. We report on our subsidiaries and affiliates where we have direct operational control, unless otherwise noted. Information is provided for leased facilities occupied for our business activities. Data, where reasonably available, are reported for facilities that we own that are leased to customers. Significant year-over-year changes are denoted.

If we cannot obtain any utility data for an office, we estimate energy consumption based on federal Energy Information Administration CBECS building energy data for.S. offices and comparable data where available for our non-U.S. offices. TravelWe utilize reports from third-party travel agencies and service providers to quantify our business travel. Our finance department provides reports of reimbursed mileage, based on data submitted via employee expense reports. Where third-party or finance department reports are not available, we estimate travel based on our understanding of employee activity. CarbonWe utilize the GHG Protocol tools provided by the World Resources Institute to translate energy consumption and travel activity into carbon emissions. Sources of these factors include the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories	174	19

The dialogue with key customers includes variety of corporate responsibility and sustainability issues, particularly green building and energy topics. Our review indicates that there may be an opportunity to generate additional value by integrating similarly inclusive mechanisms into other decision-making points within the company, such as the Community Engagement Committee. Currently, the Committee relies on the internal managers to interpret stakeholder priorities, and this structure could benefit from mechanism to obtain more direct stakeholder input to help focus allocation of resources.	174	26

The Report includes information on Prologis material sustainability and corporate responsibility performance issues and should enable stakeholders to make informed judgments and decisions. While Prologis has identified material issues, the process by which the company identifies these priorities could benefit from more formal structure. In particular, we have identified an opportunity to describe formal materiality process that explicitly integrates the company values (noted by the acronym IMPACT) as well as criteria from the well-developed risk management process.	174	27

In response, the corporate responsibility team has been reorganized and expanded the mechanisms to engage with offices and the Champions network. Energy: Prologis is clear leader in the sector with regard to energy initiatives. variety of interrelated initiatives are described in the Report including lighting upgrades, green building standards for new construction and alternate energy (solar) development on rooftops. We have identified an opportunity to pull these elements together with the community engagement efforts and the infill investment strategy, and in doing so communicate cohesive leadership strategy on energy that leverages and builds on Prologis new scale and position in the marketplace.	174	28

This recalculation was the result of our first carbon footprint verification through The Climate Registry, encompassing the required North American footprint (Scopes 1 and 2). During the verification process, we recalculated our Scope 1 emissions to include fugitive emissions from refrigerators and AC equipment. We also used updated emissions factors for mobile combustion. These changes resulted in Scope 1 verified footprint that was 335 metric tons greater than the footprint reported in our 2011 Corporate Responsibility Report. We also recalculated our Scope 2 emissions using an updated figure for estimated electricity use in offices for which utility bills were unavailable.

Skylights make up 15 percent of the buildings roof. Photocells ensure that the high-efficiency lighting system is activated only when necessary, minimizing energy costs. The buildings energy-efficient design qualified it for BREEAM Excellent certification and an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) rating.

The curved shape, rather than the flat design typical in distribution center, reduced the buildings overall volume without affecting the interior clear height. This decreased the amount of steel needed for construction and reduced the amount of space that required heating. This design feature lowered the development cost and significantly decreased the buildings operating costs. Prologis Park Pineham DC4 is the first building in our portfolio to feature this innovative roof design. Given its success, similar applications are being considered for future Prologis developments.

During construction of new developments, Prologis promotes health, safety, and environmental stewardship through contract provisions with construction contractors as well as active oversight and engagement. Although Prologis works effectively with local planning agencies, there may be additional benefits to implementing more detailed community outreach programs to engage neighbors during construction to ensure any concerns are addressed proactively.	160	159

Additional materials used in the construction process include roofing materials and lighting equipment. We use local or regional contracting for the construction of our buildings, except where necessary resources are not readily available. This effort supports local businesses and keeps our investments within the local community. Using local suppliers often reduces shipping and transportation needs, further reducing the environmental impact of our development projects.	133	98

Prologis has an extensive ongoing engagement programs across the companys value chain that covers, amongst other things, how the companys values are embedded in management process. There are clear avenues for stakeholders to provide direct and indirect feedback related to material and emerging issues for its operations. There are strong examples of how Prologis has communicated sustainability as part of its value equation and engaged customers, employees, and investors in its material issues.

We commend Prologis for developing Supplier Code of Conduct in 2013.

We recommend that the company continue to formalize the way that it uses engagement to further sustainability objectives. In particular, it would be beneficial to understand more about the risks and impacts in the construction phase and construction supply chain, particularly in the emerging markets where Prologis is based, and how the expectations of contractors play out during construction of new developments. Meeting the next level of sustainability challenges requires collaborative response as there are limitations to what Prologis can achieve on its own. Stakeholders are increasingly interested	133	130

One example is that Prologis development of roof-based solar energy is limited by legislation, client and community acceptance as well as market incentives and conditions. This could offer new commercial opportunities as well as lower carbon renewable energy sources for the communities where facilities are operated, which may produce range of benefits not only for Prologis but also for others. As such, we recommend that Prologis increase its disclosure related to its current and planned collaborations about systemic, transformational change of the built environment. Performance Information The goals and performance are presented in clear manner.

The specified data presented in the report are considered to be reliable and accurate as minimal technical errors have been identified based on our sampling. Prologis continues to improve its human resources data system and we recommend that as part of this ongoing improvement, it improve the effective tracking of all training initiatives as we were unable to fully verify 2013 numbers for performance review and Ethics Challenge trainings.

These principles include GRIs guidance on defining material aspects and boundaries to identify the most relevant environmental, social and governance impacts as they pertain to our business andstakeholders. The basis for reporting on joint ventures, subsidiaries, leased facilities, outsourced operations and other entities that can affect period-over-period comparability is detailed in our 2014 Annual Report and in our Form 10-K, which is filed with the and Exchange Commission and is also available in the SEC Filings section of Prologis website at In late 2013, working with internal stakeholders, we conducted materiality assessment to ensure	138	15
Prologis	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2014.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/p/NYSE_PLD_2014.pdf	Prologis-2014.pdf	the environmental, social and governance issues we believe are most material to our business and stakeholders are adequately addressed in our sustainability programs and reporting. We used the results of that assessment to inform the direction of this report. In 2015, we plan to expand on our internal materiality assessment by engaging with broader range of stakeholders to ensure that the issues they deem most material to our business are addressed. In our 2015 report, we expect to provide materiality matrix, detail our methodology for determining our most material issues and document our modes of engagement with stakeholders around environmental, social and governance issues. The issues most material to Prologis, according to our 2013 assessment, include the following: Employee satisfaction Customer satisfaction Anticorruption Portfolio energy use	138	16
Prologis	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2014.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/p/NYSE_PLD_2014.pdf	Prologis-2014.pdf	Sustainable building certifications, ratings and labeling Each of these issues is material and addressed in this report. We also provide data where it is available for our corporate operations and for the facilities we own and lease to our customers. Limitations include occupant operations on Prologis properties. Although we strive to work with our customers to enhance their sustainability measures, their business activities fall outside the scope of Prologis operational control and thus fall beyond the boundary of our performance-data reporting. In addition, we do not report on the business activities of entities over which we do not exercise direct operational control, including our co-investment and joint venture partners, service providers, customers, contractors, suppliers and vendors.	138	17

Our goal, and one that will receive greater focus in 2015, is to support local businesses wherever possible. This in turn will enable us to invest in the communities where we operate. Using local suppliers can reduce shipping and transportation requirements, thereby reducing environmentalimpacts. We require accident and incident data from our general contractors in the.S. We evaluate this data alongside such factors as cost and prior project experience before we make contracting decisions. Suppliers for our property management business include firms that provide landscaping, maintenance and custodial services.

Our customer satisfaction survey, which we undertake at 18-month to 2-year intervals, is one important mechanism. Through it, we seek input on topics related to leasing, facility improvements, customer service and green initiatives. In our most recent survey, completed in the summer of 2013, more than 50 percent of responding customers said they would be interested in equal cost solar energy and 30 percent said they placed priority on the use of green practices, such as energy-efficient lighting, water-saving technologies and sustainable building certifications.

We used the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Quality of Information Principles (Balance, Clarity, Accuracy, Reliability, Timeliness and Comparability) as criteria for evaluating performance information. The verification of GHG emissions was conducted using the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD)/ World Resources Institute (WRI) greenhouse gas protocol and the organizational boundaries are all global sites under Prologis operational control. All data was verified for the period between January1st to December31st, 2014.	138	112

DNV GL, in performing our assurance work, is responsible to Prologis management. Our statement, however, represents our independent opinion and is intended to inform all Prologisstakeholders. DNV GL was not involved in the preparation or data collection process of any part of the Report. This is our ninth year of providing assurance for Prologis. In addition, our sister company, DNV (U.S.A.), Inc. has been retained by Prologis to provide verification of 2014 Corporate Greenhouse Gas Inventory Scope 1 and 2 emissions using The Climate Registrys General Verification Protocol version 2.0. We adopt balanced approach toward all stakeholders when performing our evaluation.	138	113
Prologis	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2014.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/p/NYSE_PLD_2014.pdf	Prologis-2014.pdf	Our team comprised: Dave Knight, Shyla Girvetz, Natasha DSilva, and Shruthi Poonacha. Further information, including individual competencies relating to the team, can be found at: Basis of our opinion Our work was designed to gather evidence with the objective of providing assurance as defined in AA1000AS (2008). We undertook the following activities: We conducted interviews with selection of the senior officers and managers based in San Francisco, California and Denver, Colorado who are responsible for areas of management and stakeholder relationships covered by the Report. The objective of these discussions was to understand top level commitment and strategy related to corporate responsibility and Prologis governance arrangements, stakeholder engagement activity, management priorities, and systems; We visited one site in development in So Paulo, Brazil. During the site visit, we met with Senior Vice	138	114

Additional activities related to verification of GHG Scope 3 emissions We assessed GHG information systems and controls, including: Selection and management of all relevant GHG data and information; Processes for collecting, processing, consolidation and report GHG data and information; Systems and processes that ensure the accuracy of GHG data and information; Design and maintenance of the GHG information system; Systems and processes that support the GHG information system; We examined the GHG data and information to develop evidence for the assessment of the GHG assertions; We evaluated whether the evidence and data are sufficient and support Prologis GHG assertions.	138	116
Prologis	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2014.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/p/NYSE_PLD_2014.pdf	Prologis-2014.pdf	Findings On the basis of the work conducted, nothing came to our attention to suggest that the Report does not properly describe Prologis adherence to the Principles of Inclusivity, Materiality, and Responsiveness. Moreover, nothing came to our attention to suggest that the data and claims made in the Report are not accurate and complete.	138	117
Prologis	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2014.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/p/NYSE_PLD_2014.pdf	Prologis-2014.pdf	Observations Without affecting our assurance opinion, we have noted the following areas of strong practice as well as opportunities for Prologis to further improve its adherence to the Principles and reporting of performance information: Inclusivity: the participation of stakeholders in developing and achieving an accountable and strategic response to sustainability. Prologis has demonstrated commitment to ongoing engagement with internal and external stakeholders across the business systematically. As result of this structured approach, it is evident that stakeholder insight and expectations have informed the report content as well as influenced decision-making within the company. Through the Customer Advisory Board (CAB) Prologis has developed successful model for engaging with customers on the sustainability impacts that occur throughout property development stages as well as during customer use of properties	138	118
Prologis	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2014.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/p/NYSE_PLD_2014.pdf	Prologis-2014.pdf	and provided an avenue for ongoing dialogue. Prologis has demonstrated good practice in increasing customer awareness on innovative sustainability aspects of its buildings. Prologis aims to leverage this model and is exploring other opportunities for cross-sector engagement to inform the focus of its sustainabilitystrategy. Independent Assurance Statement 53 OUR APPROACH ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE We commend Prologis for its ongoing efforts to communicate and demonstrate to stakeholders that sustainability is key part of the companys value equation. We encourage Prologis to report on how it is using this dialogue to help breakdown some barriers to significant sustainability challenges such as increasing uptake of renewables.	138	119
Prologis	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2014.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/p/NYSE_PLD_2014.pdf	Prologis-2014.pdf	An area of growing emphasis for the company is responsible sourcing as reflected by the increased reporting on the companys management approach and performance in this area. In order to ensure consistency across the business regions, we recommend that Prologis continue to develop and report on systems for monitoring and reviewing supplier adherence to the code of conduct to support increased accountability and demonstrate clear link to business decisions and sustainability priorities. For example, we recommend reporting on the number of languages the Code of Conduct is translated into in relation to total languages spoken by suppliers as well as introducing mechanism to confirm understanding and implementation of the code.	138	120
Prologis	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2014.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/p/NYSE_PLD_2014.pdf	Prologis-2014.pdf	Materiality: identification of those issues which are necessary for stakeholders to make informed judgments concerning Prologis and its impacts. The report addresses the most material environmental and social issues facing the company and its stakeholders and lists the top five. As per our recommendation last year, we recommend that it provide further detail of the outcome and the relative prioritization of these and other issues. Prologis used the outputs of its first formal materiality assessment, conducted in 2013, to confirm the topics covered in the report. In addition, corporate functions including the sustainability and enterprise risk management have either participated in or conducted periodic benchmarks of the REIT sector which have provided further input into the key sustainability issues and trends which is included in the report.	138	121
Prologis	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2014.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/p/NYSE_PLD_2014.pdf	Prologis-2014.pdf	We recommend that Prologis should build on the 2013 materiality process to include external stakeholder viewpoints, which we understand is planned for next year. This should enable Prologis to analyze feedback systematically, identify current and emerging issues of greatest significance to the company and its stakeholders, effectively balance potentially divergent stakeholder priorities and hone report content. Responsiveness: the extent to which an organization responds to stakeholder issues.	138	122
Prologis	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2014.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/p/NYSE_PLD_2014.pdf	Prologis-2014.pdf	Prologis engages and responds to stakeholders throughout the companys operations. In particular, the company is committed to sustainability and prioritizes initiatives when there is clear business case, including return on investment, mitigated risk, or competitive advantage. In our opinion, this further integrates sustainability into formalized decision-making processes. To support its customers in achieving their own sustainability goals, Prologis emphasizes its ability to design and build facilities with low impact features and energy-efficient lighting that enable its customers to have more efficient and responsible operations. We recommend it extends its tenant engagement program at regional levels to both educate and enter into dialogue with customers on how it can best respond to their needs in context of sustainability performance. The biggest challenge for Prologis is to take its good	138	123
Prologis	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2014.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/p/NYSE_PLD_2014.pdf	Prologis-2014.pdf	sustainability performance and increasingly bring customers and investors along so this is aligned to the context and science of where sustainability performance needs to be, e.g., getting out of fossil fuels by mid-century. We recommend increased reporting on how it is approaching this. Performance Information The specified data presented in the report are considered to be reliable and accurate as minimal technical errors have been identified based on our sampling. The goals and performance are presented in clear manner and in way that trends are evident. We recommend, as per last year, all targets are time-bound.	138	124
Prologis	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2014.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/p/NYSE_PLD_2014.pdf	Prologis-2014.pdf	There are opportunities for some process improvements such as establishing corporate guidelines to ensure consistent data retention and document control, particularly as related to suppliers and subcontractors (e.g., recording of working hours) across business regions. Prologis should also consider Independent Assurance Statement 54 OUR APPROACH ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE including suppliers in periodic trainings around its safety and environment policies to ensure awareness among its suppliers of the companys monitoring and reporting requirements in these area. For example, the training can ensure that suppliers understand the requirement of reporting and evaluating near miss incidents in order to prevent future safety incidents. Prologis GHG assertions are that 9,834metric tons of CO2e for Scope 3 (Business Travel and Employee Commute) were emitted in 2014 from its global operations. Based on the processes and procedures	138	125
Prologis	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2014.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/p/NYSE_PLD_2014.pdf	Prologis-2014.pdf	conducted with moderate assurance, there is no evidence that these GHG assertions are not materially correct and are not fair representation of GHG data and information, and have not been prepared in accordance with the calculation method referenced above.

At Prologis, our enduring commitment to logistics real estate goes hand in hand with an equally enduring commitment to the environment, social responsibility and corporate governance. Logistics real estate is great business to be in. Across cycles and for the foreseeable future, there are resilient, structural factors driving demand, including: Rising consumption, which increases the volume of goods flowing through our network of logistics facilities. Burgeoning-commerce, which requires three times the logistics space of offline retail to accommodate packages instead of pallets, high inventory turns, wide product variety and returns. Growing emphasis on corporate efficiency, which drives demand for higher quality, better-located facilities.	144	6

Last year, we provided 105 months of rent-free space to 18 nonprofit organizations, totaling $1 million of in-kind rent. While we doubled our impact in financial terms year-over-year from 2014, still feel that this program could do more. Occupancy rates are at record levels, but still we have the capacity to provide rent-free space for short time periods to more organizations in need.

Where we have access to whole-building data, we enter and track energy, GHG emissions and water and waste data through the Urban Land Institute (ULI) Greenprint Center for Building Performances environmental management platform. Prologis reported 2014 energy data for 611 properties to Greenprint, including 447 properties for which we had consistent year-over-year information. Energy usage decreased 7.6 percent, while emissions decreased 3.7 percent from 2013 to 2014 on like-for-like basis. When normalized for occupancy, the energy use intensity is 72.2 KWh/m2 in 2013 and 67.3 KWh/m2 in 2014.

There is opportunity to explore deeper level of engagement with suppliers beyond current practices. For example, Prologis has incorporated the Supplier Code of Conduct into all supplier contracts and has also integrated new supply chain management software system to Findings On the basis of the work conducted, nothing came to our attention to suggest that the Report does not properly describe Prologis adherence to the Principles of Inclusivity, Materiality, and Responsiveness.

For example, Prologis can consider periodically convening suppliers to increase awareness of Prologis sustainability priorities in the region, provide refresh Prologis Code of Conduct and health and safety reporting requirements, and share best practices between suppliers.	144	128
Prologis	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2015.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/p/NYSE_PLD_2015.pdf	Prologis-2015.pdf	Prologis underwent materiality assessment refresh in 2015 and expanded the assessment to include wider range of topics and more varied group of internal stakeholders.

For example, Prologis focused energy strategy has not only made them leaders in energy efficiency in their industry by focusing on energy-efficient lighting, but they also demonstrate leadership in the renewable energy arena with their active incorporation of solar on their buildings.

Prologis	REIT - Industrial	Financial	2015.0	https://www.responsibilityreports.com/HostedData/ResponsibilityReportArchive/p/NYSE_PLD_2015.pdf	Prologis-2015.pdf	We recommend that Prologis consider integrating the materiality and risk management assessment exercises to ensure alignment of sustainability objectives with business processes. Responsiveness: the extent to which the organization responds to stakeholder issues Prologis systematically engages stakeholders throughout the year in order to gain feedback on the companys own performance as well as insight into stakeholders sustainability priorities. The company uses data gathered through engagement activities to inform decision-making and enhance the effectiveness of the sustainability initiatives pursued. From our review, DNV GL noted that Prologis responds to the information gathered through its engagement efforts to help stakeholders, such as its customers, achieve their own sustainability objectives and help drive their own sustainability performance forward.

In order to build on assessing impact on local communities, Prologis should consider implementing company-wide database system that retains the community stakeholder issues raised from various mechanisms in order to establish that most concerned those stakeholders. While this does effectively expand the scope of the assessment, best practice in materiality includes direct engagement with external stakeholders. We continue to recommend that the materiality assessment include external stakeholders directly as this would provide precise insights from an external perspective and would increase the credibility of the identified material issues. Materiality: identification of those issues which are necessary for stakeholders to make informed judgments concerning the organization and its impacts.	144	131

These widely recognized, voluntary and leading GHG registries help businesses measure, track and report annual GHG emissions. We understand our impacts in the broader context of sustainability and their direct causal impact on climate change.

Our 2011 baseline included fewer emission sources, and therefore we track our emission reduction goal based on the most complete data since that year (Scope 1 and Scope 2). To measure our progress, we calculate annual GHG emissions for our corporate and regional offices as defined by the GHG Protocol: 1. Natural gas 2. Refrigerants 3. Vehicle fleet 4. Purchased electricity 5. Business travel 6. Employee commute 7.

Four material topics emerged from our 2017 materiality assessment: emissions, energy, employment and anti-corruption. GRI Principles for Defining ReportContent In designing this report, the Global Reporting Initiatives (GRI) Principles for Defining Report Content guided our content, design and structure. In the past year, there have been two important clarifications to GRIs materiality principle: The first pertains to the meaning of impact, which refers to the effect an organization has on the economy, the environment and society. It does not refer to an effect on an organization. The second guides companies to consider two dimensions of the materiality principle:	158	24

In addition to the materiality assessment described in this section, the Prologis board conducts consistent and recurring enterprise risk assessments. These assessments cover many key governance issues for the company and drive strategies to ensure we meet requirements and act responsibly. Risk and governance items identified in the enterprise risk assessment align with material topics identified in the materiality assessment.	158	25

For each material topic, boundaries are defined by two factors: (1) where the impacts occur and (2) the organizations involvement with the impacts. We manage our material topics through commitments and organizational memberships, stakeholder engagement, internal HR, ethics and sustainability policies, goal setting, and instilling in our employees sense of personal and professional responsibility to the communities where they live and work.

This concrete reduces the number of joints to repair and maintain. It creates smoother work surface for forklift operators and workers in the building, and ensures surface ideal for increased automation. DWELL TIME REDUCTION Prologis is partnering with technology providers to gain insights into reducing dwell time, the duration truck or carrier spends waiting to load or unload goods at facility. longer dwell time translates to more fuel consumption, greater emissions and higher transportation costs in our customers supply chain operations. The tools we generate will help increase our customers operational efficiency and reduce GHG emissions.	71	37

Locations closer to the end consumer reduce drive times and thereby reduce resulting emissions. According to the Environmental Defense Fund, if every 1,000 customer trucks reduces their journey by 10 miles, we can avoid more than 37,000 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions.1 BROWNFIELD REDEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY COLLABORATION Prologis partnered with neighborhood mural artists to paint the exterior wall for one of our properties in the Bronx, New York, which celebrates local culture,	71	39

So it has always seemed logical that as CEO, my duty is to treat people with dignity and respect, and to care for them as best can. believe organizational leaders especially CEOs have an obligation to care for people and communities while also pursuing growth and profit for stakeholders. dont see these as opposing ideals; rather see them as complementary. In fact, believe an organization that is solely focused on profitability will not prosper in the long run.

This is why based on current projections, QTS has goal of procuring 100% renewable energy by 2025. To reach this goal, we have comprehensive plan for all QTS data centers to transition to purchasing all of their energy from renewable sources over the next several years. Today, we procure 32% of our energy from renewable sources, including on-site solar photovoltaic generation at our Piscataway and Princeton sites.

This means following efficiency best practices and creating innovative solutions that reduce our energy demand as much as possible.8,9 Some of our energy efficiency measures include utilizing the following technologies and processes: Water cooling and pumped refrigerant systems as opposed to conventional air-conditioning cooling system Water economizers that remove heat from water loop via heat exchange process with outdoor air Free cooling, method of using outside air to cool our data centers without the use of mechanical refrigeration systems Hot aisle/cold aisle airflow management at all sites, layout design for computing equipment that maximizes	85	30

We look at energy use across the board, not just in operations. For example, Electric Vehicles (EVs) produce no tailpipe emissions and overall less carbon emissions than gasoline cars, even when charged from nonrenewable energy sources. We have made EV charging stations available to employees and customers at our QTS Suwanee and Atlanta sites and at our Corporate Headquarters in Overland Park, KS, with more planned at other sites in the near future.11 10 Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator (EPA) 11 Explaining Electric & Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles (EPA) Over 160,000 blanking panels have saved approximately 4 million kWh per year (equivalent to 2.8 metric tons of carbon dioxide, or 7 miles driven by an average passenger vehicle)10 15	85	32

Even with significant increase in floor space and utilization of existing floor space, our energy usage and usage per square foot has remained fairly consistent, while our space efficiency has steadily grown. To measure our efficiency, we monitor critical energy metrics including our Power Utilization Effectiveness (PUE), the ratio of total energy used to the energy delivered to computing equipment, as well as our watts per square foot.

We strive to continue these trends, and we believe continuous monitoring of these metrics will help us do so. Water Similar to energy, data centers rely on water to help maintain indoor environments for optimal equipment effectiveness. For traditional data center, water typically is consumed at two key points of operation: 1. During the generation of electricity that the data center ends up using (indirect, responsible for about 80% of total water use) 2. For use in cooling tower-based chillers that improve energy efficiency (direct, responsible for about 20% of total water use) Given the associated environmental impact and costs, QTS is committed to reducing our water usage.12	85	34

By capitalizing on existing infrastructure-rich facilities and transforming them to meet our needs, we reduce the cost and time associated with building new. Because we believe that constant data collection and analysis is the key to constant improvement, we also track our Material Utilization Effectiveness (MUE), or the ratio of the total amount of waste we generate to the total amount we recycle, and are among the first in the industry to monitor and prioritize this metric. 2015 2018 68,000,000+ 17 QTS has reduced or recycled 550 Million pounds of industrial material to date by recycling building structures.	85	40
